# iris-flower-classification

## What problem are we trying to solve?
We are trying to use attributes of flowers to predict the species of the flower, specifically we are using the petal length and width and sepal length and width to predict if an Iris flower is of type setosa, virginica or vesicolor. This is a multiclass classification problem.
